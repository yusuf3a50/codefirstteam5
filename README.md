This is how the web app works:

1. Webform takes input of temperature, weather type and location

2. javaScript alerts happen as form validation if a field is not filled out

3. The form input is parsed to a javaScript DOM

4. This DOM rewrites the html of the section with id="welcomeAndForm" 

5. This new html will be the weather forecast that the user has requested

Tip: choose rain for a hidden Easter Egg ;-)
